# How is AI Artwork Damaging for Artists?

### Before we look at the main question, we first need to understand some background:

## What is AI

Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, is the simulation of human functions by machines that are able to complete tasks that are usually completed by people as they require human intelligence and judgement.

### Now that we understand what Artificial Intelligence actually is, we now need to understand what AI artwork is:

## What is AI artwork?

AI art is defined as art generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence. This means that AI can create works of art through machine learning. The programs use various learning algorithms that obtain knowledge from data. 

AI art is the result of a combination of an artist’s input and the AI system. However, the level of autonomy can vary considerably, and the outcome really relies on the quality of the data the AI learns from.

To create AI art, artists use AI as a creative instrument and work with the algorithms to set up rules that the machine can use to analyse thousands of images to understand particular creation processes, like specific styles or aesthetics. The algorithms then generate novel forms, shapes, figures, and patterns to produce new works.

## How Does AI-generated Art Affect Artists?

There are ethical issues concerning the use of AI generators as most, if not all, tend to steal existing artworks from real artists. This is done without the permission of the artist making it. Specific apps like Lensa are riddled with controversy. Many artists have accused the company that created Lensa of using their art without permission. Many digital artists have also expressed their concerns over AIs creating images in such large quantities cheaply. This is because these images have specific styles that artists have spent years refining. 

The app Lensa is saying that they are “bringing art to the masses” but artists like Karla Oritz say that “what they’re bringing is forgery, art theft and copying to the masses.” 

Oritz felt that the use of her art in the training of the AI model Lensa uses to generate AI art was a “violation of her identity”


Many other artists also take to social media to express their discontent:

However, some artists feel quite positively about AI. They feel that AI models are a useful creative tool. Many artists have said that it is helpful for generating reference images that can be difficult to just find online. 

Many artists such as Mateusz Urbanowicz whose watercolour artworks were used to train AI models on the AI generator program LAION-5B feels that “now we are facing the same problem the music industry faced with websites like Napster, which was maybe made with good intentions or without thinking about the moral implications.” 

Napster was, as described by Britannica, “a music file-sharing computer service created in 1999.” Napster allowed users to share electronic copies of music stored on their personal computers over the internet. This file sharing brought about a legal battle over digital rights and the development of digital rights management software to prevent computer copyright piracy.

## Testing AI Artwork Generators

I decided to try and create my own AI artwork using different free AI generators. To test these generators, I decided to pick one description to input into all of the generators to get the most accurate result. This was:

#### “a ginger cat sat on a pile of books in a forest”. 


### I decided to test a few things when using the generator:

1. How easy is it to use
2. How accurate is the image compared to the description
3. Does this image contain certain tells that it has used a real artist’s work (e.g. you can see the artists signature)
